### Fun ops - A collection of all sorts of different programs I am making that I find interesting.
Project start date: Dec 11, 2020

- NOTE: Please comment out taskdef name="launch4j" in build.xml unless your going to create executables
for the projects through ANT. In that case make sure to download
(https://sourceforge.net/projects/launch4j/files/launch4j) and paste a copy of the Launch4j folder into the root of the IDE workspace 

- List of apps in project: Calculator, Data encryption-decryption, Guessing number game, Hangman, Tic tac toe, Wiggle Mouse, Clock, Ping Pong

- log4j should already be in the project, but if not: use log4j in feature development: go to Eclipse run configurations, find and click on the program with the main class
that you want to use run, go to the Dependencies tab, click Classpath entries, advanced, add folder,
and add the folder that contains the log4j.properties file (currently lib folder). 
Additionally add the log4j jar file from lib folder to the Classpath Entries for every app's run configuration
