## Project Description

* A collection of all sorts of different cross-platform Java programs I am making that I find interesting

* Project start date: Dec 11, 2020

## Other Notes

* Please comment out taskdef name="launch4j" in build.xml unless you're going to create executables
for the projects through ANT. In that case, make sure to download
(https://sourceforge.net/projects/launch4j/files/launch4j) and paste a copy of the Launch4j folder into the root of the IDE workspace

* Optionally, if you want the apps to be digitally signed during the jar process, make sure to create a signjar-key.properties file and place it under the directory Documents\keys\signjar-key.properties. The signjar-key.properties file must have the following properties defined with values: keystore, keystore.password, key.alias, kay.password

* List of apps in project: Calculator, Data encryption-decryption, Stop watch, Guessing number game, Hangman, Tic tac toe, Wiggle Mouse, Clock, Ping Pong

* To run/do development on these apps you would need to have JDK 17 installed
